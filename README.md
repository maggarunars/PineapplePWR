Welcome to your Christmas calendar, where presence matters more than presents! We are a group of environmentally conscious and nostalgic young women who are in a fight against consumerism. Based on our user-research, other people seem to agree with us that Christmas should be about other things than buying gifts. It should rather be about spending time with your loved ones and quality time with yourself. That's why we've created a calendar that gives you ideas about various activities to do in the month of December. The activities don't have to cost much, even nothing. When you open the page, a christmas tree of gifts welcomes you. You can click on today's date to get an acticity idea. If you don't like the idea, you can refresh and get a new one. The ideas come from a database (by Supabase) of ideas we have made ourselves. A future vision for this project is to be able to click the santa's hat icon which leads you to filters. There you would be able to filter activities by location, age etc., as well as create your own activities for the calendar and place them at a random date or choose a date. 
The tech stack used in this project is VS Code, React TS, CSS, Lottie and Supabase. 
The owners of this project are Andrea Austmann,Katarína Bozáňová,Margrét Rúnarsdóttir and Rebekka Rut Maríusdóttir. 
Enjoy and merry Christmas!
